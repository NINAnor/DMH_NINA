## FAIR

The [FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) guiding principles for scientific data management illustrate the best practice for sharing open data. They were first set out in the 2016 paper [The FAIR Guiding Principles for scientific data management and stewardship](https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2016.18). The principles emphasise machineactionability (i.e., the capacity of computational systems to find, access, interoperate, and reuse data with none or minimal human intervention) because humans increasingly rely on computational support to deal with data as a result of the increase in volume, complexity, and creation speed of data.

|Initials|Description|
|:----|:----|
| **F**indable | The first step in (re)using data is to find them. Metadata and data should be easy to find for both humans and computers. This includes unique and persistent identifiers, rich metadata and that the data/metadata is registered in a searchable resource.|
|**A**ccessible | Once the user finds the required data, they need to know how they can be accessed. This includes using a standarised communications protocol and where necessary authentication and authorisation.|
|**I**nteroperable | The data usually need to be integrated with other data. In addition, the data need to interoperate with applications or workflows for analysis, storage, and processing. This includes FAIR vocabularies.|
|**R**eusable | The ultimate goal of FAIR is to optimise the reuse of data. To achieve this, metadata and data should be well-described so that they can be replicated and/or combined in different settings. This includes accurate and relevant attributes, data usage license, detailed provenance and meeting domain-relevant community standards.|

### Old text
Documentation of data using discovery and use metadata. The documentation identifies who, what, when, where, and how, and shall make it easy for consumers to find and understand data. This requires application of information containers and utilisation of controlled vocabularies and ontologies where textual representation is required. It also covers the topic of data provenance which is used to describe the origin and all actions done on a dataset. Data provenance is closely linked with workflow management. Furthermore, it covers the relationship between datasets. Application of ontologies in data documentation is closely linked to the concept of linked data.
