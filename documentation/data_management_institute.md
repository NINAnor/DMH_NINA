### Data management at MET Norway  
At MET Norway, data have always been managed, albeit in a rather narrow technical sense. The main focus has been on storage, primarily for operational data. More recently, the issues of delivering, sharing and reusing data have steadily gained prominence. Still, the legacy of data storage systems built up over many years is an important factor in any uniform data management program.

During the International Polar Year ([IPY](https://public.wmo.int/en/bulletin/international-polar-year-2007-2008)), MET Norway was the international coordinator for operational data. IPY data management was based on the principle of distributed data management through exchange of standardised descriptions of datasets between contributing data centres.

At the global level, the institute is the primary representative for Norway in the [WMO](https://public.wmo.int/en). WMO has in recent years reorganised its approach to documenting and sharing data through two major activities: [WIS](https://community.wmo.int/en/activity-areas/wis) and [WIGOS](https://community.wmo.int/en/activity-areas/WIGOS). Both are metadata-driven activities that follow the same principles as [Geonorge](https://www.geonorge.no/en/) and [INSPIRE](https://inspire.ec.europa.eu/), although there are differences concerning standards required.

### Data management at NIVA

NIVA works with complex data of many:

- Types: biological, ecological, physical, chemical
- Matrices: water, sediment, biota
- Sampling methods: sensors/loggers, FerryBox, manual sampling
- Data structures: time series along transect or in fixed position, classic stations, etc.
- Environments: rivers, lakes, marine open water, etc.

The complexity of NIVA’s data has been shown to be a challenge when it comes to overall data sharing. Nevertheless, much of our data is available in several data portals such as [Vannmiljø](https://vannmiljo.miljodirektoratet.no/), [Artsdatabanken](https://www.artsdatabanken.no/), and [ICES](https://www.ices.dk/Pages/default.aspx), and NIVA is actively working on making its data more findable and interoperable. We are a partner in many EU projects and data management responsible for some (e.g. [PAPILLONS](https://www.papillons-h2020.eu/)).

### Data management at NILU

### Data management at NINA
NINA focuses on Nature and Human-nature interactions, biodiversity, and terrestrial ecology and requires the management of a wide variety of data from different sources, in multiple formats. Based on specific agreements with national and international partners, some workflows for data sharing were implemented, for example, the species observation data delivered to the Norwegian Biodiversity Information Centre [Artsdatabanken](https://www.biodiversity.no/) reaching the Global Biodiversity Information Facility [GBIF](https://www.gbif.org/), or the Geospatial data delivered to the Norwegian Mapping authority data portal [Geonorge](https://www.geonorge.no/).

Most of the data workflows traditionally follow a project-based approach. Most often data sharing solutions were based on specific project requirements. Data management in the past was scattered with a lack of standardization (with few exceptions) and data was often invisible or unreachable to external stakeholders. 

In time, many different workflows and solutions for storing and organizing data were designed and implemented, with some attempts to centralize the storage of specific data types. Geospatial data was organized in internal file systems with naming conventions, for example, and most of the data stored in centralized databases of growing dimensions.

NINA is currently transitioning to a FAIR data-sharing model, adopting International standards and restructuring the internal policies and workflows for storing, sharing, and delivering data and metadata. Centralized metadata catalogs will allow more distributed data management with optimized solutions for finding, accessing, and processing data. Every new starting project is required to provide a Data Management Plan using the [easyDMP](https://www.sigma2.no/data-planning) tool.
