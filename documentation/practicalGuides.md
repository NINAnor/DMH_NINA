## Practical guides

### Create a Data Management Plan (DMP)

The funding agency of your project will usually provide requirements, guidelines or a template for the DMP. If this is not the case, Science Europe offers a comprehensive [Practical guide of research data management](https://www.forskningsradet.no/contentassets/e4cd6d2c23cf49d4989bb10c5eea087a/se_rdm_practical_guide_final.pdf).

For researchers with no or little experience in data management, a simple way of creating a DMP is with [EasyDMP](https://www.sigma2.no/data-planning)

### Using easyDMP

1. Log in to easyDMP, use Dataporten if your institution supports that, otherwise pick one of the other login methods.

2. Click on + Create a new plan and pick a template

3. By using the Summary button from page two and on, you can get an overview of all the questions.

*Publishing the plan*

Currently you can use the export function in easyDMP to download an HTML or PDF version of the DMP and use it further. This might change if "Hosted DMP" gets implemented.
