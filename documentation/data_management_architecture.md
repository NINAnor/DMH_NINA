## S-ENDA Architecture

FAIR data requires the smart use of various systems and solutions that are in continuous development. Infrastructures, systems, and registers are support functions around the datasets, while fulfillment of the FAIR principles requires that the datasets are well defined and well described. It is therefore important to focus on good definitions of the datasets to ensure availablity, including storage formats and information content. The diagram below defines S-ENDA's architecture.
