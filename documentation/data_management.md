## Data management roles and responsibilities
### Context
Data is processed and interpreted to generate knowledge (e.g., about the weather) for end users. The knowledge can be presented as information in the form of actual data, illustrations, text or other forms of communication. In this context, an illustration is a representation of data, whereas data means the numerical values needed to analyse and interpret a natural process (i.e., calibrated or with calibration information; it must be possible to understand the meaning of the numerical value from the available and machine-readable information).

Advanced users typically consume some type of data in order to process and interpret it, and produce new knowledge, e.g., in the form of a new dataset or other information. The datasets can be organised in different levels, such as the [WMO WIGOS definition for levels of data](https://codes.wmo.int/wmdr/_SourceOfObservation). Less advanced users apply information based on data (e.g., an illustration) to make decisions (e.g., clothing adapted to the forecast weather).

Between the data providers and data consumers are the processes that manage and deliver the datasets (Figure 1). A number of human roles may be defined with responsibilities that, together, ensure that these processes are carried out in accordance with the data management requirements of the organisation. The definition and filling of these roles depend heavily on the particular organisation, and each organisation must devise its own best solution.
