# User Portals and Documentation

## Purpose

A portal is an entry point for data consumers, enabling them to discover and search for datasets and services independently.

Here, we can distinguish between a general portal for all publishable datasets from the institution and targeted portals that offer a focused selection of data, which may include external datasets. Targeted portals cater to specific user groups and may have a limited lifetime, but also can be long-term commitments.
