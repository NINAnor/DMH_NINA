## FAIR
To follow FAIR, datasets should: 
- Be assigned a globally unique and persistent identifier. 
- Be described with rich metadata. 
- Be registered or indexed in a searchable resource. 
- Be retrivable by their identifier using a standarised communications protocol, which is open, free, universially implementable and allows for authentication where necessary. 
- Be released with a clear and accessible data usage license. 
- Be associated with detailed provenance. 
- Use a vocabulary that follows FAIR principles. 

To follow FAIR, metadata should: 
- Clearly and explicitly include the identifier of the data they describe. 
- Be accessible, even when the data are no longer available. 

Documentation of data using discovery and use metadata. The documentation identifies who, what, when, where, and how, and shall make it easy for consumers to find and understand data. This requires application of information containers and utilisation of controlled vocabularies and ontologies where textual representation is required. It also covers the topic of data provenance which is used to describe the origin and all actions done on a dataset. Data provenance is closely linked with workflow management. Furthermore, it covers the relationship between datasets. Application of ontologies in data documentation is closely linked to the concept of linked data.
