## FAIR
FAIR is an acronym that stands for Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable.

### Findable
The first step in (re)using data is to find them. Metadata and data should be easy to find for both humans and computers.
### Accessible
Once the data is found, the user needs to know how they can be accessed, possibly including authentication and authorization.
### Interoperable
Data need to be integrated with other data and interoperate with applications or workflows for analysis, storage, and processing
### Reusable
Data and collections should be well-described so that they can be replicated and/or combined in different settings.

To follow FAIR principles, datasets should: 
- Be assigned a globally unique and persistent identifier. 
- Be described with rich metadata. 
- Be registered or indexed in a searchable resource. 
- Be retrievable by their identifier using a standardised communications protocol, which is open, free, universally implementable and allows for authentication where necessary. 
- Be released with a clear and accessible data usage license. 
- Be associated with detailed provenance. 
- Use a vocabulary that follows FAIR principles. 

To follow FAIR, metadata should: 
- Clearly and explicitly include the identifier of the data they describe. 
- Be accessible, even when the data are no longer available.
