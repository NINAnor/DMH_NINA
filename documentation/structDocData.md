# Data Structure and Documentation

Structuring and documenting dynamic geodata shared by multiple providers (S-ENDA partners) is essential to ensure that data is findable, understandable reusable and interoperable.

Data need to be structured, encoded and delivered in agreed formats, documented with rich and standard metadata, and supported by standardized vocabularies.

Both discovery metadata and use metadata are exposed in a centralized catalog, harvesting metadata from original sources by standard protocols and automated procedures.

An essential prerequisite for structuring and documenting data is the specification of the dataset(s). The dataset is the basic building block of the data management models adopted in the S-ENDA context.

## FAIR
S-ENDA embraces the FAIR guiding principles for data and metadata management. FAIR is an acronym that stands for Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable. It aims at making data more useful and streamlined for both humans and computers.
