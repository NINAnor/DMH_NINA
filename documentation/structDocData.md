# Data Structure and Documentation

In order to properly find, understand and use geophysical data, standardised encoding and documentation are required, i.e., metadata.

Both discovery metadata and use metadata can be embedded in the files produced for a dataset through utilisation of self-explaining file formats. If properly done by the data producer, publication and preservation of data through services is simplified and can be automated.

An essential prerequisite for structuring and documenting data is the specification of the dataset(s). The dataset is the basic building block of our data management model; all the documentation and services described in this DMH are built on datasets. The dataset specification is the first step in structuring oneâ€™s data for efficient management, and it is mandatory.
