## Geonorge's download API


### The download API

 Ordering and downloading data from Geonorge's map catalog takes place through an API which is based on work done in collaboration with several data owners. The API is used as a common interface where different systems in Norway can order data from each other, so that other systems can order data directly from Geonorge's map catalogue. The API is available at [https://nedlasting.geonorge.no/Help](https://nedlasting.geonorge.no/Help).

The documentation of the solution that implements the Geonorge download API has been posted on [Kartverkt's GitHub.](https://github.com/kartverket/). More information about Geonorge's donwload API can be found [here](https://www.geonorge.no/verktoy/APIer-og-grensesnitt/nedlastingsapiet/).
