## Metadata

In order to properly find, understand and use geophysical data, standardised encoding and documentation are required, i.e., metadata. Metadata is a broad concept. In our data management model the term "metadata" is used in several contexts, specifically the five categories that are briefly described in [Metadata Types](metadata.md).

Both discovery metadata and use metadata can be embedded in the files produced for a dataset through utilisation of self-explaining file formats. If properly done by the data producer, publication and preservation of data through services is simplified and can be automated.
