# Data Services

This chapter presents an overview over the free services and provided by S-ENDA's partners. Implementation of the services must be in line with the instituteâ€™s delivery architecture.

Data services include:

- Data ingestion, storing the data in the proper locations for long term preservation and sharing;

- Data cataloging, extracting the relevant information for proper discovery of the data;

- Configuration of visualisation and data publication services (e.g., OGC WMS and OpeNDAP).

## Implementation

When planning and implementing data services, there are a number of external requirements that constrain choices, especially if reuse of solutions nationally and internationally is intended and wanted for the data in question. At the national level, important constraints are imposed by the national implementation of the INSPIRE directive through Norge digitalt.
